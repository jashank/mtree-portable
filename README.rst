mtree: a utility for mapping and checking directory hierarchies
========================================================================

:SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-2-Clause

The ``mtree`` utility compares a file hierarchy against a specification,
creates a specification for a file hierarchy, or modifies such a
specification.  This specification can be controlled by the user, but
typically includes file/directory/symlink names, ownership information,
permission bits, and so forth.  It may optionally also include various
hashes, such as SHA-256 or MD5.
